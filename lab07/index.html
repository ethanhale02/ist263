        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Ethan Hale</strong>, I am an information management and technology major that is very interested in cyber security. I have experience coding in python, java, and Haskell and I am familiar with the windows and linux operating systems. I also have knowledge of information security which I learned in my intro to information security class and am decent at presenting. Outside of school and work I enjoy spending time with my family and friends doing stuff such as skiing, fishing, and going to my 2 camps. I also enjoy reading, watching movies, and learning new ways to interact with technology.</p>
