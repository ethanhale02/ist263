            <b>Description:</b> This project contains 7 Haskell functions that control a robot to do multiple things. The first of the functions moves the robot from one location to another. The second, third, and forth all have to do with the robotâ€™s log, the second erases all the contents of the log, the third adds a new entry to the front of the log, and the fourth will redact a certain part of the robots log. The 5th and 6th functions are very similar, one returns the state of the robot when it picks something up and the other returns the state of the robot when it drops an item. The final function controls the whole program and returns the state when the robot performs a certain task.<br>

            <p class="project2" id="project2"><b>Name:</b> Stock Scope<br><br>
            <b>Description:</b> StockScope is a program written in python that takes a stock ticker as an input and returns real time data such as the high, low, open, close, and sales volume of that stock in a chart and graph that is easy for the user to interpret. The code uses a dropdown menu allowing the user to choose from hundreds of stock tickers which were developed using a csv file found online. This program incorporates the Alpha Vantage API which allows it to gather the real time stock data it displays. This project also used the python libraries pandas, plotly, and ipywidgets to create the graphs and interface that the user interacts with.<br>
